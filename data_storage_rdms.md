Database Design and Data Handling NotesRelational Database SchemaThe key to a good relational database schema is normalization, which means breaking down the data into separate tables to avoid redundancy and improve data integrity. The provided JSON has several nested objects (location, outcome), which are perfect candidates for their own tables.stops_and_searches TableThis is the main table, holding all the primary information about each stop and search event.stop_id (Primary Key, integer)age_range (text)officer_defined_ethnicity (text)involved_person (boolean)self_defined_ethnicity (text)gender (text)legislation (text)outcome_linked_to_object_of_search (boolean)datetime (datetime)object_of_search (text)operation (text)type (text)operation_name (text)removal_of_more_than_outer_clothing (boolean)location_id (Foreign Key to locations table, integer)outcome_id (Foreign Key to outcomes table, integer)outcomes TableThis table would store unique outcomes, preventing the same outcome name and ID from being repeated for every single stop.outcome_id (Primary Key, text)name (text)locations TableThis table would store the geographical data, linking it to the street name via a foreign key.location_id (Primary Key, integer)latitude (float)longitude (float)street_id (Foreign Key to streets table, integer)streets TableThis table would store unique street names and their associated IDs.street_id (Primary Key, integer)name (text)The main stops_and_searches table would then reference the locations and outcomes tables using their respective foreign keys. This structure makes the data much more efficient to store and query. For example, if you wanted to change the name of an outcome, you would only have to update one record in the outcomes table, not thousands of records in the main table.How the System Handles Updates and DeletionsBecause the script only fetches new monthly data and doesn't re-download or compare historical records, it would not detect updates or deletions to entries that were already downloaded in a previous run.For Updates: If an officer-defined ethnicity was changed for an entry from January 2024, your local CSV file would still contain the old, incorrect information.For Deletions: If an entry from a past month was completely removed from the API, your local CSV would still retain that record, making your data inaccurate.To handle these scenarios, the script would need a more complex process involving a full re-pull of all data or a comparison of every single record, which is inefficient.Recommended API ChangesTo make the update process more robust and efficient, I would recommend the following changes to the Police Data API:Unique Record Identifiers: Each stop and search record should have a stable, unique ID. This would allow a system to easily match and update or delete specific records in its local data store.A "Last Modified" Timestamp: A last_modified field for each record would be a game-changer. The script could then check for all records modified since its last run, regardless of the month they were originally created.Delta-Based Endpoint: The most efficient solution would be a dedicated API endpoint that allows you to query for all records that have been created, updated, or deleted since a specific date and time. For example, https://data.police.uk/api/changes?force=metropolitan&since=2024-01-01T00:00:00. This would drastically reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed daily.SQL StatementHere is the SQL statement provided:CREATE VIEW crime_type_count_by_date AS
SELECT
    DATE(datetime) AS crime_date,
    object_of_search,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM
    stops_and_searches
GROUP BY
    DATE(datetime),
    object_of_search
ORDER BY
    DATE(datetime) ASC,
    total_count DESC;
